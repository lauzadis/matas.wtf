### background
this is *not* a completed project!

I plan to build a robot arm following Chris Annin's AR4 build guide. He is a roboticist with a lot of experience designing and building robot arms using COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) components.

I've always been interested in robots but was dissuaded by the price tag (anywhere from 10-40k for an industrial robot arm!). This kit is at most $2000, but I'm buying most of the parts from AliExpress, so it should be a little cheaper. I might do a cost analysis as part of the completed post; I've purchased all the parts as of today, but there might be surprise expenses.

### the plan
I plan to first use the robot arm as method of learning robotics control theory and how it's applied in the real world. After I've got a good grip of the software and tools in the field, I hope to train this robot to make dosas. Yes, this will be a dosa bot. I have a long-term fantasy of building a fully-automated food truck which is open 24/7 and serves good food for low prices (no humans --> lower cost).

Eventually when autonomous driving becomes a thing, this food truck can even drive to the customers! It would be like Uber Eats, but the food is cooked while it's being delivered. I actually think Domino's Pizza had a concept car which cooked a pizza as it was being delivered, it would be similar to that.

I chose dosas as a food item because they're really good, easy to program (it's like flipping a pancake), and low-cost, which provides a lot of room for experimenting. They're also vegetarian, which I imagine is easier to get a food license for.

### bureaucracy
I don't think there has ever been a concept of a fully-autonomous food truck (like, no human input for days or weeks). When I was looking for licensing requirements, a lot of them were human-focused (which is reasonable), such as requiring the food truck to have a bathroom or be located near a venue with restroom access for the employees.

### why a robot arm?
When thinking of this plan, I considered using 3D printer architecture (XY gantry) to dispense dosa batter on a hot plate. While this would definitely work and be easier to start (look up pancake 3D printers), it's missing a human aspect which I thought would ultimately lead to business failure. There's something special about a robot arm making your meal that provides a closer connection to the food being made.
